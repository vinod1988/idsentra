## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Security Announcements

Security updates will be announced through GitHub's security advisory feature. Please watch the repository to receive notifications about security updates.

### Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the security team by emailing [security@idsentra.com](mailto:security@idsentra.com). You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) for the latest minor version. We recommend always using the latest version of the library to ensure you have all security updates.

## Security Updates, Alerts and Notifications

- Security releases will be tagged with a `[security]` prefix in the release notes.
- Security advisories will be published in the [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/idsentra/idsentra/security/advisories) section.
- For critical security issues, we may also publish a security advisory on the npm package page.
